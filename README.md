    <em>Build a custom data-catalog in minutes</em>
</p>

---

A data-catalog is key to easily find the trusted data you're looking for. It is game-changer when it comes to self-service analytics. And it is the entrypoint of any data-analysis.

There are many open-source projects (admundsen, datahub, metacat, atlas) to build such a catalog in-house. But as they offer a lot of advanced features, they are hard to manage and deploy if you're not a tech expert. 

**`Catalog Builder` aims to provide a `lightweight` alternative to generate a documentation website on top of your data assets.**
