## 🔍️ What is CatalogBuilder?

- CatalogBuilder is a simple tool to **generate & deploy a documentation website** on top of your **data assets**.
- It enables anyone at your company to **quickly find the trusted data they are looking for**. 

<br>

## 💡  Why CatalogBuilder?

There are **many open-source projects** (*admundsen, open-metadata, datahub, metacat, atlas*) to build such a catalog in-house. But as they offer a lot of advanced features, they are **hard to manage and deploy** if you're not a tech expert. They can be even **harder to customize**. 

**dbt docs** is great to generate a documentation website on top of your dbt assets but:

- it focuses on dbt only (while you are interested in other sources + metadata)
- is very hard to customize (except you're an angular expert)
- can be slow.

CatalogBuilder aims at offering a **lightweight alternative** to generate a documentation website on top of your data assets. It focuses on **read-only data discovery** and:

- ✔️ can be easily customized and deployed by low tech people
- ✔️ can then handle the very specific needs of your company
- ✔️ is fast and lightweight
- ✔️ is built on top of the very famous [mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) python library which is used by millions of developers to deploy their documentation (such as [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)).
