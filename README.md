## 🔍️ What is CatalogBuilder?

CatalogBuilder is a simple tool to generate & deploy a documentation website on top of your data assets. It enables anyone at your company to quickly find the trusted data they are looking for.

## 💡  Why CatalogBuilder?

There are many open-source projects (admundsen, open-metadata, datahub, metacat, atlas) to build such a catalog in-house. But as they offer a lot of advanced features, they are hard to manage and deploy if you're not a tech expert. They can be even harder to customize. 

`CatalogBuilder` aims to provide a *lightweight* alternative to generate a documentation website on top of your data assets. It focuses on *read-only data discovery* and:

- ✔️ can be easily customized and deployed by low tech people
- ✔️ can then handle the very specific needs of your company
- ✔️ is fast and lightweight
- ✔️ is built on top of the very famous [mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) python library which is used by millions of developers to deploy their documentation (such as [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)).
